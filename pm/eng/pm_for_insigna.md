## 3 Emblem

### 3.1 Official Emblem

The chapter's logotype is distinguished by the letters I and N as two parts of a horisontal lightning bolt, encompassed in a 45 degree tilted square that depicts a stylized microchip.  

The official logotype looks like this:

![The chapter's logo, in color](./img/logo_in_600px.png)

The legs of the microchip shall be of the color "kiselblå" (see §1.2 in the chapter's statutes) and the centrum shall have a darker tone of the same color (for example `#262D33`). The lightning bolt shall be white (`#FFFFFF`).

### 3.2 Monochrome Emblem

In the case when the official emblem can not be displayed without difficulties there is a monochrome emblem to use, for example for use on clothes or posters.  
In the monochrome version the microchip's legs have the same color as the lightning bolt, while the centrum is void of color.

Below is an example in black (`#000000`).
