In order to pass a revision of this memo, a decision has to be made with a qualified majority at two subsequent chapter meetings.

## 2 Organisation

The Stickkontaktsansvarig is elected by the chapter meeting.

If the chapter meeting finds it very well justified, it may elect additional Stickkontaktsansvariga for the same operational year.

## 3 Activities

A Stickkontaktsansvarig has no formal responsibilities within the chapter's operations, but is encouraged to take responsibility for the wellbeing of the chapter's electrical plugs, extension cords and power strips.

## 4 Regulations

The position of Stickkontaktsansvarig is a honorary position, and should therefore be elected from those who have been involved and furthered the development of the chapter.

A person holding the position of Stickkontaktsansvarig shall hold no other elected position within the chapter.
